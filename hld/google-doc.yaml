given:
    - Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
    - All users should see changes in near real-time (within 1 second).
    - The system must support conflict resolution and offline editing (sync when online).
    - Scale: 
      - 10M monthly active users, 1M documents, 50k concurrent editors.

functional-requirements:
  - user editing doc simultaneously
  - conflict resolution
  - 

non-functional-requirements:
  - high-throughput
  - scalable
  - low latency (real-time)

services:
  - conflict-resolution-service (runs on OT or CRDT, idk how they resolve conflict, but they can be used)

editor-service:
  - 50k concurrent editors -> heavy write and we need real-time change reflection, so redis cluster with doc-id for sharding
  - DB: cassandra (storing docs and edits)
  - cache: redis-cluster 


communication protocol for editing and syncing - web-socket
