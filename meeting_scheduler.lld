Questions that can be asked in an interview
How do you check for overlapping meetings during creation?
    using check_for_conflicts() for a given time range

What happens if two people try to book the same slot at once?
    for online_meetings(without room_id), they can book meetings, it is upto the user whether to accept the invite or not

Can a user book overlapping meetings for themselves?
    yes, he can book - conflict can be shown as warning

How would you optimize the get_free_slots query for performance?
    get_free_slots should be queries with limit and order by start_time_i desc 

Would you use RDBMS or something else for storing meeting data?
    use mysql

How would you scale this for a large organization (e.g., Google Calendar scale)?

How would you allow meetings across time zones?

-- How would you handle daylight savings time?

How would you store recurring meetings?

How would you notify invitees about meeting changes (cancel/reschedule)?
